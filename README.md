## Machine Learning coursework.

### [Coursework 1.](mzdun001_CW1.ipynb)
Task: Write my own code that performs nested cross-validation and the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, estimate distances between data 
samples, build confusion matrices and calculate performance metrics.

#### Deliverables:
A single jupyter notebook, including:
- Working, fully documented, code for the assignment (Data analysis, implementation of kNN, a nested-cross validation using the kNN implementation, 
a summary of results)
- Answers to the questions provided

### [Coursework 2.](mzdun001_CW2.ipynb)
Task: An implementation of logistic regression. This is
based on the data provided by the Wikipedia example “Probability of passing an exam versus
hours of study” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).

#### Deliverables:
A single jupyter notebook, including:
- Working, fully documented, code for the assignment
- A brief report detailing the workings of the solution (in markdown)
- Answers to the questions provided
